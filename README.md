# Microcontroller Programming : ECE 2534
This is the repository for my class at Virginia Tech on Microcontroller Programming. It features code for a PCI32MX7 microcontroller and its subsequent accellormeter, OLED screen, and joystick accessories we utilized in conjunction with it.

In this class, we learned the following things:
* Microcontroller vs Microprocessor
* Interrupts and priority of tasks
* UART, I2C, SPI, Serial Interfaces
* Setting registers to allow/disallow for functionality
* Pinouts and how to utilize pins on board for analog/digital IO
* Accelerometer based event triggers to cause subsequent functionality in code
* Microcontroller frequency and how to leverage it to write code at a rate
